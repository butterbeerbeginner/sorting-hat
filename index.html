        The Sorting Hat's Song: 
          "Oh you may not think I'm pretty,
          But don't judge on what you see,
          I'll eat myself if you can find
          A smarter hat than me.

          You can keep your bowlers black,
          Your top hats sleek and tall,
          For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
          And I can cap them all.

          There's nothing hidden in your head
          The Sorting Hat can't see,
          So try me on and I will tell you
          Where you ought to be.

          You might belong in Gryffindor,
          Where dwell the brave at heart,
          Their daring, nerve, and chivalry
          Set Gryffindors apart;

          You might belong in Hufflepuff,
          Where they are just and loyal,
          Those patient Hufflepuffs are true
          And unafraid of toil;

          Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,
          if you've a ready mind,
          Where those of wit and learning,
          Will always find their kind;

          Or perhaps in Slytherin
          You'll make your real friends,
          Those cunning folks use any means
          To achieve their ends.

          So put me on! Don't be afraid!
          And don't get in a flap!
          You're in safe hands (though I have none)
          For I'm a Thinking Cap!"
